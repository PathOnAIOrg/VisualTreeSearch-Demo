    Guidelines for determining if the goal is finished:
    1. Review the list of actions taken during the web browsing session.
    2. Compare these actions to the stated goal of the task.
    3. Consider if the necessary information has been found or if the required interactions have been completed.
    4. Look for indicators of task completion, such as finding specific information, completing a purchase, or submitting a form.
    5. If the last actions suggest that the main objective has been achieved, consider the goal finished.
    6. If there are clear next steps that haven't been taken, the goal may not be finished.

    Remember:
    - Web browsing tasks often involve multiple steps like searching, navigating pages, filling forms, or extracting information.
    - The goal is finished when all necessary actions to complete the task have been taken.
    - If the actions deviate significantly from the goal without resolution, the goal may not be finished.

    Respond with 'goal_finished: true' if you determine the goal has been accomplished, or 'goal_finished: false' if it's still in progress or incomplete."""
